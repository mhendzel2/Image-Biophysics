############################################################
# Recommended Python version: 3.10.x or 3.11.x
# Reason: Many AI/scientific packages (stardist, n2v, csbdeep) require NumPy <2.0
# which is incompatible with Python 3.13. NumPy 1.x doesn't have wheels for Python 3.12+.
# Use Python 3.10 or 3.11 for best compatibility.
# Use pyenv / conda to create a Python 3.10 or 3.11 environment.

# Optional AI segmentation / restoration extras
cellpose>=3.0.0  # Uses newer architecture compatible with NumPy 1.x
# Note: stardist and n2v have conflicting csbdeep requirements
# Install separately: pip install stardist OR pip install n2v csbdeep<0.8.0
# stardist>=0.9.0  # Requires csbdeep>=0.8.0
# csbdeep>=0.7.4
# n2v>=0.3.3  # Requires csbdeep<0.8.0 - conflicts with stardist
# TensorFlow - Note: Use Python 3.11 if you need TensorFlow <2.16
# For Python 3.12+, only TensorFlow 2.16+ is available
# tensorflow>=2.16.0  # optional; uncomment if needed for AI methods
